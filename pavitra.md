I am a PhD student in the Health Data Lab at the Department of Computer Science at The Arctic University of Norway. Before joining PhD, I worked in software development, big data and data analytics for six years in the IT industry. I have been passionate about designing and building scalable medical systems.
During my PhD, I have been working to solve one of the major bottlenecks in healthcare research: data accessibility due to regulatory compliances. To resolve the issue of data accessibility, generate synthetic data, often known as realistic data, mimics real data but is false. Synthetic data generation uses neural network techniques like Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion models.
The objective is to develop an open-source platform to generate synthetic data using neural network models for various healthcare data types.
